1. Polar Bears are my favorite animal
2. I swam competitively for almost 15 years and am now part of the club Crew team at Stevens
3. I am a St. Louis Cardinals fan

- I love spending time outside and going hiking, swimming, exploring, etc.
- I have driven to every state east of the Mississippi River (I have family all over the place)
- When I grow up, I want to live in a house on a rural beach
